# 🦎 Parser MediaWiki — Configurable API crawler for multiple Wikis by `NewtCode`

Parser MediaWiki is a Python MediaWiki API crawler designed to collect content from multiple wiki installations using separate settings per wiki (endpoints, namespaces, rate limits, auth, and export rules). It retrieves pages, revisions, categories, and related metadata and normalizes the output for downstream processing. Built for repeatable runs, it helps keep large-scale wiki data collection consistent across sources.
